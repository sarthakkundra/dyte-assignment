# URL Shortener

### Core features
1. CRUD short urls
2. Google oAuth
3. View analytics per url

## Things I'd like to improve (given 24 hrs more)
1. Refactor Login Logout components into a HoC
2. Re rendering the URLs table with every CRUD operation.
3. Performance upgradations using useMemo, useCallback etc where the functions do not need to re execute / render.
4. UI responsiveness
